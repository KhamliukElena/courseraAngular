Tasks for coursera course "Single Page Web Application with AngularJS" by Johns Hopkins University. Link to the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-page-web-apps-with-angularjs/

These are my solutions to coding assignments of the course.

Task 1. The page checks if number of items for lunch is too much. Link: https://khamliukelena.github.io/courseraAngular/week1/index.html

Task 2. There is a pre-made shopping list. The application "checks off" items which have been already bought. Link: https://khamliukelena.github.io/courseraAngular/week2/index.html

Task 3. A simple search of menu item description. Using a key word (e.g. "chicken", "soup", etc.) finds all mentions in the menu. There is an option to delete an item from the list. Link: https://khamliukelena.github.io/courseraAngular/week3/index.html
